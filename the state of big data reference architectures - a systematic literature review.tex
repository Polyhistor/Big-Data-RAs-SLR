\section{Introduction}

The rapid development of software technologies, the proliferation of digital devices and networking infrastructure of today, have by and large, augmented userâ€™s capability to generate data \cite{AtaeiSecurity}. In the age of information, users are unceasing generators of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that if collected and crunched correctly, may reveal game-changing patterns \cite{AtaeiACIS}.

The unprecedented proliferation of data have emerged a new ecosystem of technologies; one of these ecosystems is big data \cite{AtaeiHype}. Big data is a term emerged to describe large amount of data that comes in various forms from different channels. Within the years, big data has attained a lot of attention from academia and industry, and many strive to benefit from this new material (Erevelles, Fukawa, & Swayne, 2016). Howbeit, adopting big data requires the absorption

\section{Front matter}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples. You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you are submitting to.

\section{Bibliography styles}

There are various bibliography styles available. You can select the style of your choice in the preamble of this document. These styles are Elsevier styles based on standard styles like Harvard and Vancouver. Please use Bib\TeX\ to generate your bibliography and include DOIs whenever available.

Here are two sample references: \cite{Feynman1963118,Dirac1953888}.

\section{Improvements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The current writing style looks like a summary description, lacks new insight on the topic. The overall contribution needs to be enhanced.
    \item The author raises seven research questions, but how does the author develop these questions? Are these real questions that have never been discussed? The research questions need to be developed according to the literature. In this way, we can realize what is the gap on this topic.
    \item The inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are ambiguous and questionable. Is it possible for readers to reproduce this study according to these criteria? Did the author perform the reliability and validity tests? The author needs to provide more detail about the review methodology.
    \item In general, each larger-scale system requires a more understanding of architectural components, owing largely to the complex nature of system architects. However, I cannot find a case that the authors demonstrate the uniqueness of BD systems, and the actual development challenges in BD systems.
    \item Although this study adapts SLR approach, it should not completely miss a literature reviewing section. It is necessary to provide to the reader the preliminary details which are necessary to understand the purpose of this study, techniques and key concerns of the various research work that the authors have reviewed. There is no theoretical argument to support the development of the research questions.
    \item The findings yielded by investigating the research questions of this SLR should constitute many discussion points around the research and practice of BD systems. However, the manuscript is completely missing a discussion section. One should expect that the results of SLR can inform the current knowledge and provide several research directions for future research. 
    \item Last, one of the core challenges with the paper is to situate it within an ongoing scholarly conversation. The authors currently reference a fairly diverse set of papers, but remain at a fairly abstract level when it comes to elaborating how your work builds upon and expands existing work. In turn, this makes it difficult to appreciate theoretical implications of your work.
